# HackathonCode
Just some short code from a hackathon I did early this year

Important lesson learned from this: just because you like Convolutional Neural Networks does not mean you should waste time working on them when they aren't designed for temporal data. Multiple network designs were predicting 0 always because of a lack of preprocessing. Should have used a Recurrent design or at least tried to do more preprocessing to make the amount of data from each class equal. But hey, you win some you lose some. We did well in the end by using a basic SVM.
